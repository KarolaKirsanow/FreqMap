# FreqMap

FreqMap is a tool written in Python for plotting allele frequencies - or any data that can be expressed as a pie chart - on a map. FreqMap has a GUI interface and is based in the basemap extension of the matplotlib plotting library. It takes a csv input file with fields: site name, latitude, longitude, freq1, and freq2.

The program uses map backgrounds based on NASA's blue marble imagery adapted to reflect the sea level and global ice coverage at several points in prehistory. These maps were created using data from the Blue Marble 3000 project  (http://radar.zhaw.ch/bluemarble3000_en.html). A second set of hypsometric maps is adapted from source files available from naturealearthdata.com. FreqMap is also compatible with basemap built-ins. This version was developed as a weekend project to plot ancient DNA data.

FreqMap: It's super freq-ay.
